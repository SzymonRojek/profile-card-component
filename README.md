[Frontendmentor.io](https://www.frontendmentor.io/dashboard) challenge to build profile card component using HTML and CSS:
* build out the project and get it looking as close to the design as [possible](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/profile-card-component-cfArpWshJ) &#8592; check it out the link or the design folder.

## **For this challenge I used:**
* HTML semantic elements;
* Invisible content just for Screen Reader users;
* BEM naming;
* Pseudo-elements for background images and border;
* SASS;
